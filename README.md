Simple KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) C++ implementation.

Tested on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04).

Compilation: runs "make" on terminal in the KNN directory. This must generates a "knn.exe" executable file.

Execution: runs "./knn.exe" on terminal.

During execution follow strictly the rules presented.

Its possible to copy the samples from Gafanhoto_Esperanca_Samples file and paste them during execution - in the "Samples Insertion" stage.
